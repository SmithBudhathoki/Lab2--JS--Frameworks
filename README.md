# Lab2-JS-frameworks - Node.js & Modules Assignment

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project was developed as part of Lab Assignment #2 for the JavaScript Frameworks module. The main goal of this assignment is to demonstrate an understanding of **Node.js**, **ES6 modules**, and how to build reusable functions across multiple files in a modular architecture.

The project includes two core JavaScript files:

- `index.js`: The main application entry point, where the program runs and interacts with the user.
- `utilities.js`: A custom utility module containing four uniquely designed functions, each serving different purposes.


## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Node.js** (server-side JavaScript runtime)
- **ES6 Module Syntax** (`import` / `export`)
- **Visual Studio Code** (as the development environment)


## ðŸ§© Module Functions (`utilities.js`)

1. **Welcome Function**  
   A simple greeting function that prints a personalized welcome message.

2. **Unit Conversion Function**  
   Converts Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit using a mathematical formula.

3. **Math Operation Function**  
   Calculates the factorial of a given number using an iterative loop.

4. **Advanced Function**  
   Checks if a given word is a palindrome (reads the same backward).

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Make sure Node.js is installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository or download the files.
3. Open a terminal in the project folder.
4. Run the application using:

node index.js
